# host_installOpts.py -- drive the FreeBSD ISO install via bsdinstall's
# scripted mode instead of OCR-driving the 25-screen TUI. Used by the
# powerpc64 conf (no upstream cloud image), and any future FreeBSD ISO
# target (e.g. another arch whose VM-IMAGES dir is empty).
#
# Flow:
#   1. wait for "Console type [vt100]:" -> hit enter
#   2. wait for Welcome dialog -> pick "Live System" via accelerator 'L'
#   3. wait for getty login prompt on ttyu0 -> log in as root
#   4. push install_runner.sh through inputFileNC, which:
#        a. writes /tmp/installerconfig (PARTITIONS, DISTRIBUTIONS,
#           post-install rc.conf / sshd_config / root password)
#        b. runs `bsdinstall script /tmp/installerconfig` non-interactively
#        c. shutdown -p so QEMU exits cleanly and the outer build pipeline
#           moves on to the boot-from-disk phase via start_and_wait().
#
# Cloud-image FreeBSD targets never set VM_ISO_LINK, so run_hook("installOpts")
# is never called for them. No gating is needed inside this hook.
