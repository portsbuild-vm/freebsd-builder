# Print the newest FreeBSD -RELEASE version that has published VM images,
# e.g. "15.1". Empty output means "nothing detected" and is not an error;
# a non-zero exit means detection itself is broken (network error, HTTP
# error, or a page that no longer matches the expected shape) and must be
# reported by the caller, never swallowed. A failure must NEVER print a
# plausible-but-wrong version -- the version is only printed after every
# step below has succeeded.

# Source of truth: https://download.freebsd.org/releases/VM-IMAGES/
# Fetched and confirmed by hand (2026-07-26): the directory is a plain
# Apache/lighttpd-style autoindex, one row per line, e.g.
#   <a href="15.1-RELEASE/" title="15.1-RELEASE">15.1-RELEASE/</a>
# The same listing also holds -ALPHA/-BETA/-RC snapshot directories, e.g.
#   14.4-BETA1/  14.4-BETA2/  14.4-BETA3/  14.4-RC1/  15.0-ALPHA1/
# alongside the real releases (14.3-RELEASE, 14.4-RELEASE, 15.0-RELEASE,
# 15.1-RELEASE at the time of checking). Only directories whose name ends
# in the literal "-RELEASE/" are real releases; anything else (snapshot
# suffix, or the unrelated README.txt entry) must never be picked.
#
# stdlib only (urllib.request, re, sys, os) -- no external dependencies.

def resolve_natural_key():
    """Return the engine's own natural_key, or fail loudly.

    watch.yml clones base-builder INTO the builder repo root, so at
    detection time it sits at "base-builder/" (relative to this hook's
    cwd, the builder repo root). A local checkout instead has it as a
    sibling, "../base-builder". Try both, in that order.

    There is deliberately NO local fallback copy. Ordering must be the
    single rule the engine uses -- a per-hook duplicate would have to be
    kept in sync by hand across every builder and would drift silently,
    and a hook that ranks versions differently from watch.py is worse
    than one that refuses to run. Both real contexts (CI and a local
    sibling checkout) always provide base-builder, so an ImportError here
    means the environment is wrong: report it as broken detection rather
    than guessing an order.
