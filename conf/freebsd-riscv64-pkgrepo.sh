# In-guest install script for the FreeBSD 15.x riscv64 images (piped into
# the guest sh by build.py with ANYVM_PKGS prepended).
#
# pkg.FreeBSD.org publishes NO riscv64 packages, so these images used to
# ship with none at all and could offer only the package-less sync
# methods. anyvm-org/freebsd-pkg-repo builds the ports tree for
# FreeBSD:15:riscv64 with poudriere under qemu-user and publishes the
# packages as GitHub release assets, signed with an ECDSA key; this
# script points pkg at that repository and then installs ANYVM_PKGS from
# it.
#
# The repository is sharded because a GitHub release holds a limited
# number of assets: anyvm.conf carries one repository block per shard, so
# it grows as the tree is built out. The copy baked in here is the one
# that existed when the image was built -- packages published into LATER
# shards are invisible until the image is rebuilt, or until the user
# refetches anyvm.conf from the index release (the URL below).
